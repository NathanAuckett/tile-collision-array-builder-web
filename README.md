# Tile Collision Array Builder

This small app is designed to make it easy to draw collision arrays for the tile collision system of a classic sonic-like game.<br>
<br>
When complete it should be able to draw individual tiles as a reference, allowing the user to then make the tile collision arrays match the reference tile.<br>
You then copy the exported json into the actual game for use.<br>
<br>
This tools functions are programmed in TypeScript.
